# inf-einf-labs

This repository consists of various branches that empower the [inf-lab.dev](https://inf-lab.dev) site. This is mainly done for a nice separation of concerns.

-   [`main`](https://github.com/Kuschel-Swein/inf-einf-labs/tree/main): This branch contains various meta-information files and some utility scripts that help working on the other branches.
-   [`check`](https://github.com/Kuschel-Swein/inf-einf-labs/tree/check): This branch contains the checks used by [check50](https://github.com/cs50/check50).
-   [`content`](https://github.com/Kuschel-Swein/inf-einf-labs/tree/content): This branch contains the actual (markdown) content for the website.
-   [`jekyll`](https://github.com/Kuschel-Swein/inf-einf-labs/tree/jekyll): This branch contains configurations for the jekyll site that don't tend to change that often.
